# ndarray-interp

Interpolation extensions for [ndarray](https://github.com/bluss/rust-ndarray).

Early stage WIP library for the moment, and may not end up being published as a separate crate in the future - most of this may instead be introduced into ndarray directly.
This will depend on design decisions for the most part.
